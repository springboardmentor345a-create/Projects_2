## How to Use

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Notebooks in Sequence
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Execute in order:
1. `01_Data_Loading_EDA.ipynb`
2. `02_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`
3. `03_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`
4. `04_Encoding_Feature_Selection.ipynb`
5. `05_Data_Visualization.ipynb`

### Step 3: Review Outputs
- Check generated CSV files in the project directory
- Review visualization PNG files
- Examine data quality metrics in notebook outputs

## Modular Design Benefits

### Advantages
1. **Token Limit Compliance**: Each notebook stays well within limits
2. **Independent Execution**: Run notebooks separately as needed
3. **Easy Debugging**: Isolate and fix issues in specific stages
4. **Clear Workflow**: Sequential progression through preprocessing
5. **Reusability**: Modify individual stages without affecting others
6. **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend

### Notebook Independence
- Each notebook loads data from the previous stage
- Can re-run any notebook without re-executing all previous ones
- Clear input/output file naming convention

---

## Data Quality Metrics

### After Preprocessing:
- **Zero missing values** in all datasets
- **No duplicate records** remaining
- **Standardized column names** (lowercase, underscores)
- **Consistent data types** across all features
- **Encoded categorical variables** ready for ML models
- **33 unnecessary columns dropped** for optimization

### Datasets Ready for Modeling:
1. **Match Prediction Dataset**: Features for predicting match outcomes
2. **Top Scorer Dataset**: Features for predicting leading goal scorer
3. **Points Tally Dataset**: Features for predicting team points and league winner

## Next Steps (Phase 2: Model Building)

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Load preprocessed data** from `data_final_*.csv` files
2. **Split data** into training and testing sets
3. **Train regression models**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - LightGBM Regressor

4. **Evaluate models** using:
