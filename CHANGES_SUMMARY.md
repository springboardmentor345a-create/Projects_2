## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to optimize the ScoreSight project by removing unnecessary columns, cleaning up documentation, and ensuring compliance with the problem statement.

---

## Major Changes

### 1. Column Optimization (33 Columns Dropped)

#### Match Prediction Dataset
- **Original:** 40 columns
- **Final:** 26 columns
- **Dropped:** 14 columns (35% reduction)

**Columns Removed:**
- `unnamed:_0` - Index column
- `date_encoded` - Redundant temporal information
- `htformptsstr_encoded`, `atformptsstr_encoded` - Redundant form strings
- `hm1-5_encoded`, `am1-5_encoded` - 10 individual match result columns

**Reason:** Individual match results are redundant as team form is already captured through streak statistics and form points.

#### Top Scorer Prediction Dataset
- **Original:** 34 columns
- **Final:** 21 columns
- **Dropped:** 13 columns (38.2% reduction)

**Columns Removed:**
- `unnamed:_0` - Index column
- `starts`, `minutes`, `90s_played` - Redundant time metrics
- `goals_+_assists` - Derived feature
- `non_penalty_goals_+_assists_per_90`, `xg_+_xag_per_90`, `npxg_+_xag_per_90` - Derived per-90 stats
- `yellow_cards`, `red_cards` - Not relevant for scoring prediction
- `progressive_carries`, `progressive_passes`, `progressive_receives` - Not directly related to goals

**Reason:** Focus on core scoring metrics and remove discipline/progressive stats that don't directly predict goals.

#### Points Tally & League Winner Dataset
- **Original:** 16 columns
- **Final:** 10 columns
- **Dropped:** 6 columns (37.5% reduction)

**Columns Removed:**
- `target_top_4`, `target_top_6`, `target_relegated` - Secondary targets
- `wins`, `draws`, `losses` - Redundant (captured in points_per_game)

**Reason:** Focus on primary objectives (champion and points) and eliminate redundant match result counts.

## Problem Statement Compliance

### Original Problem Statement
Predict:
1. Match Outcomes (scores and winners)
2. Top Scorer (season's leading goal scorer)
3. League Winner & Points Tally (team points and champion)

### How Changes Align

#### Match Prediction
- **Kept:** Essential features like goals, form points, streaks, goal difference
- **Dropped:** Redundant encoded features and individual match results
- **Result:** Cleaner dataset focused on team performance indicators

#### Top Scorer Prediction
- **Kept:** Core scoring metrics (goals, assists, xG, per-90 stats)
- **Dropped:** Derived features, discipline stats, progressive play metrics
- **Result:** Focused dataset on actual scoring ability

#### League Winner & Points
- **Kept:** Performance metrics (points_per_game, goals, goal_difference)
- **Dropped:** Secondary targets and redundant match results
- **Result:** Streamlined dataset for primary prediction objectives
