# GEMINI.md - Project ScoreSight

## Directory Overview

This directory contains data for a football (soccer) machine learning project, likely named "ScoreSight". The project's goal appears to be predicting match winners and season outcomes like league champions. The directory includes historical match data and season summaries.

## Key Files

* **`Match Winner.csv`**: This file contains detailed historical data for individual football matches. Each row represents a match and includes information such as the date, home and away teams, goals scored, and various form and performance metrics. This dataset is likely used for training a model to predict the outcome of future matches.
* **`ScoreSight_ML_Season_LeagueWinner_Champion.csv`**: This file provides a summary of team performance at the season level. It includes statistics like matches played, wins, draws, losses, and points per game. It also contains target variables such as `target_champion`, `target_top_4`, and `target_relegated`, which suggests its use in models that predict end-of-season outcomes.
* **`AI_ScoreSight Doc.pdf`**: This is likely the project's documentation, which may contain details about the project's objectives, methodology, and data dictionary.
* **`Goals & Assist.xlsx`**: This Excel file probably contains data on player goals and assists, which could be used as features in the machine learning models.
* **`LICENSE`**: This file contains the license for the project.

## Usage

The data in this directory is intended for use in a machine learning project to predict football match and season outcomes. The typical workflow would be:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Analyze the data in the CSV and Excel files to understand the features and prepare them for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Use the prepared data to train machine learning models to predict match winners, league champions, and other outcomes.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics
